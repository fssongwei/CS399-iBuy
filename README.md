## Introduction

iBuy is a shopping list Android application. It allows users to list the items they want to buy, marked the price, amount and urgent level of each item, and share your shopping list within a group (family, friend, etc). 

A household goes through tons of "consumables": food, toilet paper, laundry detergent, you name it. It is a huge challenge for households to track and manage these daily needs. Though various household members are moving around the city all day --- and could potentially make efficient on-the-way purchases --- in reality, no one knows or can remember what needs to be purchased and who is supposed to purchase it. Which means wasted time, extra trips to the store for one item, and general frustration about eating dry cereal, washing your hair with facial soap, and wiping your bottom with paper towels. We've all been there. Or worse yet, multiple people remember to buy and you end up with 400 rolls of toilet paper. iBuy will solve this problem forever.
